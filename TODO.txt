* convert messy init code into completely different
  files without ifdefs (not much in common!)
* move all machine specific code into separate files
* rename all labels that point to RTS to RTSn
* add AppleSoft comments
* look for all " $", i.e. (zeropage) constants, replace them
  with symbols
* check all .ifdef OSI; they might be .ifdef CONFIG_SMALL
