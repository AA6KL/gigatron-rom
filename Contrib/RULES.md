"""You can do your own thing in "Contrib/<GitHubUserName>/...".
Everything that appears there coming from that user I will accept
blindly (well, if it is legal). It is your own playground. You can
still advertise what is in there in the root README.md. Everything
changed outside Contrib/ needs to be discussed/reviewed more properly.
Everything changed inside Contrib/username by other usernames needs
the same review treatment."""
