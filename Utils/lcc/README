LCC for Gigatron
================

C compiler targetting the Gigatron TTL computer

ANSI C cross-compiler (C89) that generates .gt1 files. These files
can be loaded with the Loader application and sendFile.py, or
embedded into an EPROM, or loaded into a Gigatron emulator.

Based on Pat Gavlin's initial work on adding a Gigatron backend to
`lcc`. Requires Python 3.6+.

This is still very much work in progress, some of thee many
restrictions include:
 * No floating point
 * Work on libraries has barely started
 * 'long' and 'long long' are 16-bit
 * Sometimes hangs or crashes
 * ...
