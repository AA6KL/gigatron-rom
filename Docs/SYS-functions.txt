vCPU's SYS extensions
=====================

SYS extensions, or SYS functions, are a method to mix vCPU code
with native Gigatron code, mostly for acceleration purposes. The
SYS function will be in ROM, because that's from where native code
executes.

The release ROMs come with a set of predefined SYS functions. Any
application in GT1 format can use those freely, provided they do a
version check first.

You can also write your own application-specific SYS functions, but
then you better publish your program as a ROM file, not GT1.

SYS extensions are called with the `SYS' instruction from vCPU.
Their ROM address must be put in `sysFn' in zero page. Optional
arguments are in sysArgs[0:7]. It is also common to pass an input
and return value through vAC.

SYS functions are free to do whatever they want, as long as they
play well with the rules of the timing game. For simplicity of
implementation, vCPU measures elapsed time in integer number of
"ticks". 1 tick equals two hardware CPU cycles (1 cycle is 160 ns,
so 1 tick is 320 ns). All vCPU instructions and SYS functions
therefore execute in an even number of cycles. A `nop' must be
inserted if the cycle count would be odd without it.

Rule 1
------

SYS functions must complete and reenter the vCPU within their maximum
declared time. This maximum duration is passed to vCPU through the
operand D of the SYS call. Although the *caller* must feed this
maximum value into vCPU, the caller may only pass a value that
matches with the SYS function's own declaration. vCPU in turn uses
this value to decide if the function can complete in the remainder
of the current timeslice, or if it must wait for the start of the
next one. The total allowed time is 28-2*D clocks or cycles, with
D<=0. This includes all overhead including that of the SYS vCPU
instruction itself.

Reserving an insufficient number of ticks results in broken video
signals. It's OK for the caller to "ask" for, or "reserve", more
time than will be used. This may only result in getting dispatched
in a later timeslice than strictly necessary. Still, some of the
more complex built-in SYS functions declare a higher value than
their implementation needs. This is to allow for future bug fixing
without changing the caller in existing programs.

[Side note: One way to see the raw value of D is as the *excess*
number of ticks that vCPU must accomodate for, but represented as
a number <=0. By default vCPU already accounts for 28 cycles for
standard instructions.]

Rule 2
------
On return, SYS functions always report back, in hardware register
AC, how much time they have *actually* consumed. This returned value
is the negated number of whole ticks spent. Miscounting results in
broken video signals. vCPU uses this to know how much time has
actually passed. This may be less than reserved, but never more.

These rules restrict SYS calls to relatively simple operations,
because they must fit in the time between two horizontal pulses,
including overhead. This translates to roughly ~130 CPU cycles at
most. In reality they typically replace a small sequence of vCPU
instructions.

Loops are normally not possible. Small loops are usually unrolled
to reduce overhead. Still, some SYS functions implement iteration
by setting back vPC just before returning. This causes them to be
dispatched again, possibly in the next timeslice.

[Side note: It's best to study the cycle count annotations in the
ROM source code for concrete examples on how things are typically
done: how the return value is passed back to vCPU, how branches are
annotated and how sometimes `nop' instructions are inserted to make
the total cycle count even.]

Naming
------
The naming convention is: SYS_<CamelCase>[_v<V>]_<N>

With <N> the maximum number of clocks or cycles (not ticks!) the
function will need, counted from NEXT to NEXT. This duration <N>
must be passed to the 'SYS' vCPU instruction as operand, represented
as `270-max(14,<N>/2)'. In GCL you can just type `<N>!', and the
compiler translates the operand for you. The gt1dump tool disassembles
and displays <N>.

If a SYS extension was introduced after ROM v1, the version number
of introduction is included in the name as v<V>. This helps the
programmer to be reminded to verify the actual ROM version. A program
must fail gracefully on older ROMs, or at least not crash. See also
Docs/GT1-files.txt on using `romType' for this purpose.
